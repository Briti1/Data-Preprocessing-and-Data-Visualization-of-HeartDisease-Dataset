# Data-Preprocessing-and-Data-Visualization-of-HeartAttack-Dataset

1. Project Overview
The project uses a dataset heartdisease.csv, which contains various features that can be used to predict the presence(1) or absence(0) of heart disease in patients. The primary focus of the project was on data preprocessing and data visualization, with the intent to better understand the structure of the dataset and the relationships between different features.

2. Data Collection and Initial Exploration
The Heartdisease.csv dataset was first imported and explored to get an overview of its structure. This step typically involves checking the number of records,understanding the columns types and values it contains, understanding the types of features (categorical vs. numerical), and inspecting the target variable that indicates whether a patient has heart disease or not. Initial exploration helps to identify potential issues such as missing data, incorrect data types, or outliers that need to be addressed during preprocessing.

4. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical part of any machine learning project. In this project, several preprocessing techniques were applied to ensure the data was clean and suitable for analysis. Missing values, if any, should be handles using imputer or removal but in our case there were no null valuse so no handling required. Categorical variables were encoded into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Numerical features were scaled or normalized to ensure consistency and to prevent features with larger ranges from dominating the model training process.

6. Outlier Detection and Removal
Another important aspect of data preprocessing was identifying and handling outliers. Outliers can skew the results of statistical analysis and machine learning models. We uses the IQR (Interquartile Range) method, to identify and remove extreme outlier values from the dataset. Ensuring that only relevant, non-extreme data is used to improving the reliability of any future model training.

8. Data Visualization
With the data preprocessed, the next step was data visualization. Visualization helps to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between features, as well as the distribution of the target variable. For instance, one might visualize the distribution of sex among patients with heart disease versus and target(Presence or Absence) or examine the correlation between disease data in male vs females. This step aids in making data-driven decisions and gives valuable insights into the dataset.
